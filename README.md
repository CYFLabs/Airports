# Airports
========
The basic idea it's to have an open database of the airports codes and information on each languange. By now, it will be only English but we will be adding more. Also, there are several formats, such as CSV and JSON. 


Special thanks to [JSON-Airports](https://github.com/jbrooksuk/JSON-Airports) and [airport-codes](https://github.com/ram-nadella/airport-codes).
